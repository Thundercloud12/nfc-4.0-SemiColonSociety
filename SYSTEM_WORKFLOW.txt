SYSTEM WORKFLOW - NFC 4.0 MATERNAL HEALTHCARE PLATFORM
======================================================

USER REGISTRATION & AUTHENTICATION FLOW:
----------------------------------------
1. USER ACCESSES PLATFORM
   → Next.js application loads
   → NextAuth.js handles authentication
   → Role-based redirection (pregnant/asha/family)

2. PATIENT REGISTRATION
   → User fills registration form
   → Data stored in MongoDB via Mongoose
   → NextAuth.js creates secure session
   → JWT token generated for authentication

3. ROLE-BASED DASHBOARD ACCESS
   → Pregnant users → Patient Dashboard
   → ASHA workers → ASHA Dashboard
   → Family members → Family Dashboard

SYMPTOM LOGGING WORKFLOW:
------------------------
1. PATIENT INITIATES SYMPTOM LOGGING
   → Clicks "Log Symptoms" button
   → Navigates to symptom logger page
   → AI conversation interface loads

2. CONVERSATIONAL SYMPTOM COLLECTION
   → Patient describes symptoms (text or voice)
   → Web Speech API converts voice to text
   → Message sent to /api/patient/symptom-chat

3. AI PROCESSING & RESPONSE
   → Google Gemini AI analyzes symptoms
   → AI asks follow-up questions
   → Conversation continues until completion
   → Patient says "stop" to end session

4. AUTOMATIC PRIORITY ASSESSMENT
   → AI extracts structured symptom data
   → Calls /api/symptom-priority endpoint
   → Gemini AI assigns priority (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH)
   → Medical recommendations generated

5. DATA STORAGE & FEEDBACK
   → Symptom log saved to MongoDB
   → Priority assessment stored
   → Patient receives immediate feedback
   → Dashboard updated with new log

EMERGENCY ALERT WORKFLOW:
------------------------
1. EMERGENCY BUTTON ACTIVATION
   → Patient clicks emergency button
   → 60-second cooldown prevents spam
   → Geolocation API requests location

2. LOCATION CAPTURE & PROCESSING
   → GPS coordinates obtained
   → Data sent to /api/emergency endpoint
   → Patient information retrieved from database

3. ASHA WORKER NOTIFICATION
   → Emergency alert triggered
   → Twilio SMS API sends alert to ASHA
   → Alert includes patient details and location
   → Immediate response coordination enabled

PUSH NOTIFICATION WORKFLOW:
--------------------------
1. NOTIFICATION SUBSCRIPTION
   → Patient/Family subscribes to notifications
   → Service Worker registers push subscription
   → VAPID keys authenticate subscription
   → Subscription stored in user profile

2. ASHA NOTIFICATION SENDING
   → ASHA worker accesses notification panel
   → Selects notification type (appointment/health/custom)
   → Composes message content
   → Triggers bulk notification send

3. NOTIFICATION DELIVERY
   → /api/push/send-bulk processes request
   → Web Push API delivers notifications
   → Service Worker handles received notifications
   → Notifications displayed to users

APPOINTMENT MANAGEMENT WORKFLOW:
-------------------------------
1. APPOINTMENT SCHEDULING (ASHA)
   → ASHA worker accesses patient list
   → Creates new appointment entry
   → Sets date, time, location, reason
   → Appointment stored in MongoDB

2. PATIENT NOTIFICATION
   → Push notification sent to patient
   → Email notification (if configured)
   → Dashboard updated with appointment

3. APPOINTMENT TRACKING
   → Status automatically updated based on date
   → Missed appointments flagged
   → Patient dashboard shows status
   → Follow-up actions triggered

OFFLINE FUNCTIONALITY WORKFLOW:
------------------------------
1. OFFLINE DETECTION
   → Navigator.onLine API monitors connectivity
   → Service Worker handles offline scenarios
   → IndexedDB stores data locally

2. OFFLINE DATA STORAGE
   → Symptom logs stored in IndexedDB
   → User actions queued for sync
   → Critical data preserved locally

3. ONLINE SYNCHRONIZATION
   → Connection restored detection
   → Background sync triggered
   → Local data uploaded to server
   → Conflicts resolved automatically

FAMILY ACCESS WORKFLOW:
----------------------
1. FAMILY CODE GENERATION
   → Patient shares access code
   → Code links to patient record
   → Limited permissions assigned

2. FAMILY DASHBOARD ACCESS
   → Family member enters code
   → Authentication verified
   → Read-only patient data displayed

3. MONITORING CAPABILITIES
   → View appointment schedules
   → Monitor symptom logs
   → Access emergency contact info
   → Limited notification access

MULTILINGUAL SUPPORT WORKFLOW:
-----------------------------
1. LANGUAGE SELECTION
   → User selects preferred language
   → UI translations applied dynamically
   → Language preference stored

2. AI LANGUAGE PROCESSING
   → Gemini AI responds in selected language
   → Voice recognition supports multiple languages
   → Text-to-speech in native language

3. CONTENT LOCALIZATION
   → Database content translated
   → Error messages localized
   → Cultural adaptation implemented

DATA FLOW ARCHITECTURE:
----------------------
1. CLIENT-SIDE (Browser)
   → React components render UI
   → State management with hooks
   → API calls to Next.js backend
   → Local storage with IndexedDB

2. SERVER-SIDE (Next.js API)
   → API routes handle requests
   → Authentication middleware
   → Database operations via Mongoose
   → External API integrations

3. DATABASE LAYER (MongoDB)
   → User profiles and authentication
   → Symptom logs and priorities
   → Appointment scheduling
   → Notification subscriptions

4. EXTERNAL SERVICES
   → Google Gemini AI processing
   → Twilio SMS delivery
   → VAPID push notifications
   → Geolocation services

SECURITY WORKFLOW:
-----------------
1. AUTHENTICATION
   → NextAuth.js session management
   → JWT token validation
   → Role-based access control

2. DATA PROTECTION
   → HTTPS encryption in transit
   → Environment variable security
   → Input validation and sanitization

3. PRIVACY CONTROLS

   → User consent management
   → Data retention policies

ERROR HANDLING & RECOVERY:
-------------------------
1. NETWORK FAILURES
   → Automatic retry mechanisms
   → Offline fallback strategies
   → User feedback on failures

2. AI SERVICE FAILURES
   → Graceful degradation
   → Default priority assignments
   → Manual intervention options

3. SYSTEM MONITORING
   → Error logging and tracking
   → Performance monitoring
   → Automated recovery procedures
